# Rock Paper Scissors

A Java implementation of a Rock Paper Scissors computer.

The computer uses a pattern recognition algorithm to predict what the user will enter next based on their last four moves.
Initially, the computer will make predict randomly until enough moves are stored to make a prediction.
When the user exits the game, the patterns will be saved. 

Two difficulties are provided when the user starts the program. Beginner difficulty matches the user against a computer with no patterns in its memory. Veteran difficulty matches the user against a computer with the patterns from previous games in its memory.
